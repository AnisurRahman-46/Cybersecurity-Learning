Welcome to Day 03 of your Cybersecurity journey. Today we will learn the **basics of GitHub**, an essential tool for managing code, documentation, notes, and collaboration.

I know this isn't related to Cybersecurity learning but GitHub is an important application for any technical student. Today we will be learning some basics of Github which will help you to showcase your skills and learning to others which will also help you to land your Dream job. 

## 💡 Why GitHub is Useful for Technical Students

```bash
# Version Control
Track your progress over time — see what changed, when, and why.

# Project Portfolio
Showcase your work — let others (and recruiters) see your coding & learning journey.

# Collaboration
Work with friends or teams — contribute to projects and learn from real-world codebases.

# Markdown Notes
Create organized, readable technical notes using Markdown — better than Word or Notepad.

# Free Hosting
Host your projects, portfolios, or documentation with GitHub Pages — no cost.

# Resume Booster
A well-maintained GitHub profile = instant credibility in tech interviews.

Now we have learnt how to make your own Repository, Files and README.md files. Now we will take a look how to `FORK` (Copy some other Public Repo). Let's get started. 

---

## 🍴 What is a Fork in GitHub?

A **Fork** is a copy of someone else's repository that lives in **your own GitHub account**.

🔸 It allows you to:
- Experiment with changes without affecting the original project
- Make contributions via Pull Requests (PRs)
- Learn from real-world open-source projects

> "Forking is like cloning a project into your workspace — but on GitHub!"

---

## 🛠️ How to Fork a Repository – Step-by-Step

### ✅ Step 1: Find a Repository
- Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
- Search or open any public repository you want to fork

### ✅ Step 2: Click on the Fork Button
- On the top-right corner of the repo page, click the `Fork` button
- GitHub will ask where you want to fork it (choose your account)

### ✅ Step 3: Fork is Created!
- Now you will see the same project in your GitHub account
- The title will show like: `your-username/project-name`

### ✅ Step 4: Make Changes
- You can now:
  - Edit files
  - Add your own files
  - Create branches
  - Commit changes freely

### ✅ Step 5: Contribute Back (Optional)
- If you want to contribute to the original repo:
  - Click `Pull requests` tab
  - Click `New pull request`
  - Describe your changes and submit

## 📌 When to Use Fork?

- Want to contribute to open source projects
- Want to study or remix someone's work
- Want a starting template for your own project

## 🗑️ How to Delete a Forked Repository on GitHub

Sometimes you may want to delete a forked repo after experimenting or contributing.  
Here’s how you can safely remove it from your GitHub account.

---

### ⚠️ Warning:
Once deleted, the repo and its data (issues, branches, code, etc.) **cannot be recovered** unless you have a local backup.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Navigate to your forked repository (e.g., `your-username/forked-repo`)
3. Click on the **⚙️ Settings** tab (top right of the repo page)
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the **Settings** page
5. Under **"Danger Zone"**, find the section:
6. Click the **Delete this repository** button
7. GitHub will ask you to **type the repo name** to confirm
8. Type the name exactly and click **"I understand the consequences, delete this repository"**

✅ Done! The forked repo is now deleted from your account.

---

### 💡 Tip:
Deleting your fork **does not affect the original repository**. It only removes your copy from your account.

---

> Clean workspace = clear mind. Delete what you no longer need.
