# 📌 What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical Hacking**, also known as **Penetration Testing**, is the practice of intentionally probing computer systems, networks, and applications to identify vulnerabilities and security loopholes. Ethical hackers use the same techniques as malicious hackers but with **legal authorization and for a good purpose** — to secure systems before real attackers can exploit them.

### ✅ Purpose:
- Identify security weaknesses.
- Protect sensitive data.
- Prevent potential cyberattacks.
- Improve overall security.

# 📌 Types of Hackers

A breakdown of the major hacker types based on their intent and methods:

---

### 1️⃣ White Hat Hacker
- 🟢 **Ethical security experts**.
- Legally hired to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Perform penetration tests and risk assessments.

**Example:**  
A cybersecurity specialist hired by a bank to test their online banking system for security issues.

---

### 2️⃣ Black Hat Hacker
- 🔴 **Criminal hackers**.
- Illegally exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.

**Example:**  
A hacker breaking into a corporate database to steal customer records.

---

### 3️⃣ Grey Hat Hacker
- ⚪ **In-between White and Black Hat**.
- Hack without permission but often report vulnerabilities.
- Motivated by curiosity or challenge.

**Example:**  
A hacker finding a bug on a website and reporting it without authorization.

---

### 4️⃣ Red Hat Hacker
- 🔴🎯 **Vigilante hackers**.
- Hunt down Black Hat hackers aggressively.
- Use offensive tactics to disable malicious attackers.
