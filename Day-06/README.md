> Welcome to Day-06 Hackers, Today we will be discussing about **_📖 Ethical Hacking & Types of Hackers_**. So let's get Started.

---
First of all, we will be discussing What is **_HACKING_** ?

> - **Hacking** is the process of identifying and exploiting weakness in a system or a network to gain unauthorized access to data and system resources.
> - It can also be defined as an unauthorized intrusion into the information systems/networks by an attacker by compromising the security.
> - Example of Hacking: Exploiting the weakness of default password to gain access to the data stored inside the system.

# 📌 What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical Hacking**, also known as **Penetration Testing**, is the practice of intentionally probing computer systems, networks, and applications to identify vulnerabilities and security loopholes. Ethical hackers use the same techniques as malicious hackers but with **legal authorization and for a good purpose** — to secure systems before real attackers can exploit them.

### ✅ Purpose:
- Identify security weaknesses.
- Protect sensitive data.
- Prevent potential cyberattacks.
- Improve overall security.

# 📌 Types of Hackers

A breakdown of the major hacker types based on their intent and methods:

---

### 1️⃣ White Hat Hacker
- 🟢 **Ethical security experts**.
- Legally hired to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Perform penetration tests and risk assessments.

**Example:**  
A cybersecurity specialist hired by a bank to test their online banking system for security issues.

---

### 2️⃣ Black Hat Hacker
- 🔴 **Criminal hackers**.
- Illegally exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.
- Engage in data breaches, ransomware, and identity theft.

**Example:**  
A hacker breaking into a corporate database to steal customer records.

---

### 3️⃣ Grey Hat Hacker
- ⚪ **In-between White and Black Hat**.
- Hack without permission but often report vulnerabilities.
- Motivated by curiosity or challenge.

**Example:**  
A hacker finding a bug on a website and reporting it without authorization.

---

### 4️⃣ Red Hat Hacker
- 🔴🎯 **Vigilante hackers**.
- Hunt down Black Hat hackers aggressively.
- Use offensive tactics to disable malicious attackers.

**Example:**  
Tracking and crashing command servers of a ransomware gang.

---

### 5️⃣ Hacktivist
- ⚡ **Politically or socially motivated** hackers.
- Attack government or corporate systems to protest or expose injustice.

**Example:**  
Defacing a government website as a protest against a controversial policy.

---

### 6️⃣ Script Kiddie
- 🎮 **Amateur hackers**.
- Use pre-made tools and scripts without deep knowledge.
- Mostly hack for fun or attention.

**Example:**  
Launching a simple DDoS attack using downloaded software.

| Type             | Intent                        | Legality | Tools Used         | Example Action                         |
|:----------------|:------------------------------|:----------|:------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| White Hat        | Defensive / Ethical            | ✅ Legal   | Professional tools | Company penetration testing            |
| Black Hat        | Malicious                      | ❌ Illegal | Exploits, malware  | Data theft, ransomware                 |
| Grey Hat         | Mixed                          | ❌ Illegal | Similar to both    | Unapproved vulnerability reporting     |
| Red Hat          | Offensive (against bad guys)   | ⚠️ Often illegal | Aggressive tools   | Disabling Black Hat servers            |
| Hacktivist       | Political / Socially motivated | ❌ Illegal | Defacement tools   | Hacking government sites for protests  |
| Script Kiddie    | Fun / Attention seeking        | ❌ Illegal | Downloaded scripts | Minor hacks like website defacements   |

# 🔐 CIA Triad in Cybersecurity

The **CIA Triad** is a **core security model** used to guide organizations and cybersecurity professionals when designing policies for keeping data safe.  
It stands for:

- **C — Confidentiality**
- **I — Integrity**
- **A — Availability**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3628cdd2-ff86-4fd7-bf10-f3a57ff93845)
  

It helps ensure that sensitive data is **protected**, remains **accurate**, and is always **accessible to authorized users**.

---

## 📖 Components of the CIA Triad:

| **Component**       | **Meaning**                                                                 | **Example**                                                     |
|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔒 **Confidentiality** | Ensuring that data is **only accessible to authorized people**. | Password protection, encryption, multi-factor authentication. |
| 📝 **Integrity**       | Making sure data is **accurate and not tampered with**.               | Hashing, checksums, file permissions, digital signatures.       |
| 🌐 **Availability**    | Ensuring that **authorized users have access to data when needed**.   | Server backups, disaster recovery plans, redundant systems.      |

---

## 📌 Who Uses the CIA Triad?

- **Cybersecurity analysts**
- **Network administrators**
- **Ethical hackers**
- **IT security teams**
- **Government security agencies**
- **Businesses handling sensitive user data**

Anyone involved in protecting computer systems, networks, or data uses this model as a foundation for securing information.

---

## 📌 Why is the CIA Triad Important?

Because it:
- Provides a **framework for securing information systems**
- Helps identify **security risks and vulnerabilities**
- Guides the implementation of **security measures and policies**
- Is essential for **protecting personal, financial, and business data**

---

## 📌 Simple Scenario Example:

Imagine an online banking app:
- **Confidentiality:** Your password and account details should only be visible to you.
- **Integrity:** The balance in your account should reflect actual transactions — no one should alter it without authorization.
- **Availability:** You should be able to access your account anytime without server downtime.

> If any one of these fails, the security of the system is compromised.
