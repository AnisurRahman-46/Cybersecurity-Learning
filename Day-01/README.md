# 🛡️ Day 01: Introduction to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking

Welcome to **Day 01** of your journey into the world of **Cybersecurity** and **Ethical Hacking**.  
This session introduces you to the **core fundamentals** and **operational domains** that define modern cybersecurity.

---

## 📌 What is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.  
These cyberattacks are usually aimed at:

- Accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information  
- Extorting money from users  
- Interrupting normal business processes  

> **"Cybersecurity is not just a technology issue, but a business and human-centric concern."**

## 🔐 Three Key Domains in Cybersecurity


Cybersecurity is broadly classified into **three operational domains**, each with a distinct role in securing digital infrastructure:

### 1. 🟦 Blue Team (Defensive Security)

- **Focus**: Detection, prevention, and incident response  
- **Tools**: SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR, Firewall  
- **Activities**: Monitoring, log analysis, threat hunting, patching  

### 2. 🟥 Red Team (Offensive Security)

- **Focus**: Ethical hacking, simulating real-world attacks  
- **Tools**: Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, Kali Linux  
- **Activities**: Penetration testing, social engineering, exploitation  

### 3. 🟪 Purple Team (Collaboration)

- **Focus**: Bridge between Red & Blue teams  
- **Activities**: TTP (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures) sharing, joint simulations  
- **Goal**: Continuous improvement of detection and defense mechanisms
