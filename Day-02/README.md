Let's Start Our DAY-02 :-

# Types of Cybersecurity Threats


## 🔐 1. Phishing
Attackers send fake emails or messages to steal sensitive info like passwords or bank details.

**Example:**  
Email: *"Your bank account is blocked, click here to fix it."*

**Scenario:**  
You click the link, enter details — attacker steals your money.

---

## 🔐 2. Ransomware
Malware locks your files and demands money to unlock.

**Example:**  
Downloaded a free movie — PC locks and asks ₹50,000.

**Scenario:**  
Lose access to documents, photos, and projects.

---

## 🔐 3. Malware
Malicious software made to harm systems.  
**Types:** Virus, Worm, Trojan, Spyware.

**Example:**  
Free cleaner app installs spyware.

**Scenario:**  
It reads your browser history and passwords.

---

## 🔐 4. Social Engineering
Tricking people into sharing sensitive info.

**Example:**  
Fake bank staff calls asking for your OTP.

**Scenario:**  
You share it, attacker empties your account.

---

## 🔐 5. Man-in-the-Middle Attack
Attacker secretly reads or changes communication between two people/devices.

**Example:**  
Using public Wi-Fi, hacker reads your messages.

**Scenario:**  
Your email and credentials get stolen.

---

## 🔐 6. Zero-Day Attack
Attacker uses a new, unknown software flaw before it's fixed.

**Example:**  
New app update has a bug, attacker uses it to control devices.

**Scenario:**  
Thousands of users get hacked overnight.
